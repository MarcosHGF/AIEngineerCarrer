# LLMs & RAG

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), enabling the creation of AI systems capable of understanding, generating, and interacting with human language in unprecedented ways. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a crucial technique to make LLMs more accurate, up-to-date, and reliable by connecting them to external knowledge bases.

## Essential Topics

*   **LLM Fundamentals:** Architectures (Transformer, GPT, BERT), attention mechanisms, pre-training and fine-tuning, prompt engineering, zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot learning.
*   **Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Techniques for generating coherent and relevant text, including sampling, beam search, and top-k/top-p sampling.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Understanding the RAG architecture, which combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with information retrieval from external sources to ground responses and reduce hallucinations.
*   **Vector Databases:** Storage and indexing of vector embeddings for similarity search, essential for the retrieval phase of RAG.
*   **Embeddings:** Generating numerical representations of text (and other data) that capture their semantic meaning, allowing for similarity comparisons.
*   **LLM Fine-tuning:** Techniques to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks or data domains with resource efficiency, such as QLoRA, LoRA, and PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning).
*   **Private/Local LLM Deployment:** Strategies and tools for running LLMs on local hardware or in private cloud environments, ensuring privacy and control.
*   **LLMOps:** Managing the lifecycle of LLMs in production, including versioning, monitoring, optimization, and automation.
*   **AI Agents:** Building autonomous systems that use LLMs to reason, plan, and execute complex tasks, interacting with tools and environments.

## Essential Tools and Technologies

*   **Frameworks for LLMs and Agents:**
    *   **LangChain:** A powerful framework for developing applications with LLMs, allowing component chaining, memory management, interaction with external tools, and agent building.
    *   **LangGraph:** An extension of LangChain that enables building more robust and complex agents using execution graphs, facilitating reasoning and decision-making.
    *   **LlamaIndex:** Focused on data ingestion, indexing, and retrieval for LLM applications, especially for RAG, optimizing search in large data volumes.
*   **Vector Databases:**
    *   **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, widely used for embedding indexing.
    *   **Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB:** Dedicated vector databases optimized for storing and searching embeddings at scale, essential for production RAG.
*   **LLM APIs:**
    *   **Hugging Face API:** Access to a vast collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned models, including LLMs, for inference and fine-tuning.
    *   **OpenAI API:** Access to OpenAI's GPT models for various NLP tasks and text generation.
    *   **Other Provider APIs:** Google Gemini API, Anthropic Claude API, etc.
*   **Local/Private LLM Deployment:**
    *   **Ollama:** A tool for easily running open-source LLMs locally, offering an OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   **vLLM:** A fast and efficient inference server for LLMs, optimized for throughput and low latency.
    *   **LM Studio:** A desktop application that facilitates discovering, downloading, and running open-source LLMs on local machines.
*   **Fine-tuning Tools:**
    *   **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning):** Hugging Face library that implements techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA for efficient LLM fine-tuning, significantly reducing computational resources required.

## Practical Projects

*   **Customer Support Bot with RAG:** Build a chatbot that answers complex questions by retrieving information from a knowledge base (e.g., PDF documents, FAQs) using RAG with LangChain/LlamaIndex and a vector database (FAISS or Pinecone).
*   **Article Generation System with Fine-tuning:** Fine-tune an LLM (using PEFT/LoRA) on a dataset of articles from a specific domain and create an application that generates new articles based on prompts.
*   **Autonomous Research Agent:** Develop an AI agent using LangGraph that can search the web, summarize information, and answer complex questions, leveraging LLMs and search tools.
*   **Local LLM Deployment for Code Generation:** Set up an open-source LLM (e.g., Code Llama) using Ollama or vLLM on a local server and create a simple interface to generate code snippets or refactor existing code.
*   **Question-Answering System for Legal Documents:** Implement a RAG system that allows users to ask questions about extensive legal documents, retrieving relevant sections and generating concise and accurate answers.
