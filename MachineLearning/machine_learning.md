# Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is the field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. For an AI Engineer, mastering ML means being able to build, train, and evaluate predictive and classification models to solve business problems.

## Essential Topics

*   **ML Fundamentals:** Understanding of different types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), bias-variance concepts, overfitting and underfitting, and the importance of cross-validation.
*   **Classic Algorithms:** In-depth knowledge of algorithms such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Means, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
*   **Ensemble Models:** Techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance and robustness, such as Bagging (Random Forest), Boosting (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), and Stacking.
*   **Model Evaluation:** Performance metrics for different types of problems (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC for classification; MSE, RMSE, R2 for regression), learning curves, and confusion matrices.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for preparing data for model training, including normalization, standardization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
*   **Hyperparameter Selection and Optimization:** Methods for finding the best combination of hyperparameters for a model, such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian optimization.

## Essential Tools and Technologies

*   **Python Libraries:**
    *   **Scikit-learn:** The standard library for classic Machine Learning in Python. It offers a wide range of algorithms, data preprocessing tools, model selection, and evaluation.
    *   **XGBoost:** An optimized implementation of gradient-boosted trees, known for its speed and performance on tabular problems.
    *   **LightGBM:** Another implementation of gradient-boosted trees, developed by Microsoft, which is even faster and more efficient on large datasets.
    *   **CatBoost:** Developed by Yandex, it is a Gradient Boosting library that handles categorical variables well and offers high model quality.
*   **Experimentation Platforms:**
    *   **MLflow:** For tracking experiments, managing models, and packaging ML projects.
    *   **Weights & Biases (W&B):** Platform for experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration in ML projects.

## Practical Projects

*   **Spam Email Classification System:** Build a spam email classifier using Scikit-learn, applying text preprocessing techniques and evaluating model performance.
*   **Stock Price Prediction:** Develop a regression model (using XGBoost or LightGBM) to predict future stock prices based on historical data and financial indicators.
*   **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions:** Implement an anomaly detection or classification model (using Scikit-learn or CatBoost) to identify fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.
*   **Building a Movie Recommendation System:** Create a content-based or collaborative filtering recommendation system, using ML techniques to suggest movies to users.
