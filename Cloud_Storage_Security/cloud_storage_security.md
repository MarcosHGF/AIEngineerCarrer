# Cloud / Storage / Security

Cloud Computing, data storage, and security are fundamental pillars for building and operating AI systems at scale. This area covers the knowledge needed to efficiently use cloud infrastructures, manage large volumes of data, and ensure the protection and compliance of AI systems.

## Essential Topics

*   **Cloud Computing Fundamentals:** Service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models (public, private, hybrid), benefits, and challenges of the cloud.
*   **Cloud Providers:** In-depth knowledge of the main cloud providers and their services relevant to AI/ML.
*   **Cloud Data Storage:** Storage types (object, block, file), managed databases (relational, NoSQL, data warehouses), cloud data lakes.
*   **Cloud Networking:** Concepts of virtual networks, subnets, security groups, load balancers, and DNS in cloud environments.
*   **Cloud Security:** Shared responsibility models, identity and access management (IAM), data encryption (in transit and at rest), network security, auditing, and logging.
*   **Data Governance:** Policies and processes for managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data in AI systems, including compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Cost and Resource Optimization:** Strategies for monitoring and optimizing cloud infrastructure costs, efficiently utilizing resources.
*   **Containers and Orchestration:** Deployment and management of containerized applications in the cloud (Docker, Kubernetes).

## Essential Tools and Technologies

*   **Cloud Providers:**
    *   **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** The largest cloud provider, with a vast array of services for compute (EC2, Lambda), storage (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB), networking (VPC, Route 53), security (IAM, KMS), and ML (SageMaker).
    *   **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** Known for its data and ML services, including compute (Compute Engine, Cloud Functions), storage (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud SQL, Firestore), networking (VPC, Cloud DNS), security (IAM, Cloud KMS), and ML (Vertex AI).
    *   **Azure (Microsoft Azure):** Offers comparable services, with strong integration with the Microsoft ecosystem, including compute (VMs, Azure Functions), storage (Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB), networking (Virtual Network), security (Azure AD, Key Vault), and ML (Azure Machine Learning).
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Tools:**
    *   **AWS IAM, Google Cloud IAM, Azure Active Directory:** For managing permissions and access to cloud resources.
*   **Encryption Tools:**
    *   **AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault:** Key management services for data encryption.
*   **Logging and Monitoring Tools:**
    *   **AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor:** For collecting logs and metrics from cloud resources.
*   **Containerization and Orchestration:**
    *   **Docker:** For packaging applications.
    *   **Kubernetes:** For orchestrating containers at scale (EKS, GKE, AKS).
*   **Data Governance:**
    *   Tools and frameworks for implementing data governance policies, such as **Apache Atlas** or native cloud provider solutions.

## Practical Projects

*   **Deploying an AI Web Application in the Cloud:** Deploy a web application (e.g., an ML inference API with FastAPI) on a cloud provider (AWS EC2/Lambda, GCP Cloud Run, Azure App Service), configuring networking, security, and load balancing.
*   **Building a Secure Cloud Data Lake:** Set up a Data Lake in AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage, implementing security policies (IAM, encryption) and data versioning. Create a simple pipeline for data ingestion.
*   **Cloud Security Monitoring System:** Configure logging and monitoring of cloud resources (e.g., S3 bucket access logs, API call logs) and create alerts for suspicious activities.
*   **ML Data Backup and Recovery:** Implement a backup and recovery strategy for ML models and datasets stored in the cloud, ensuring data resilience.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for ML Team:** Configure an IAM system for an ML team, defining specific roles and permissions for access to compute, storage, and model resources.
