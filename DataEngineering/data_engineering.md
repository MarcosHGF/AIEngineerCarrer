# Data Engineering

Data Engineering is the backbone of any AI system, responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure for collecting, storing, processing, and transforming large volumes of data. The goal is to ensure that data is available, clean, and ready for analysis and Machine Learning modeling.

## Essential Topics

*   **Database Fundamentals:** Understanding of relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, data modeling, query optimization, and schema management.
*   **ETL/ELT Pipelines:** Design, build, and maintain Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) pipelines to move data between systems.
*   **Large-Scale Data Processing:** Techniques and tools for handling large volumes of data (Big Data), including batch and streaming processing.
*   **Data Lakes and Data Warehousing:** Architectures for storing raw data (Data Lakes) and structured data for analysis (Data Warehouses), and the differences between them.
*   **Workflow Orchestration:** Automation and management of complex and dependent data tasks.
*   **Data Quality and Governance:** Implementation of processes to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and reliability, as well as compliance with security and privacy policies.
*   **Pipeline Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of data pipeline performance and health to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Essential Tools and Technologies

*   **Programming Languages:**
    *   **Python:** Widely used for scripting, automation, and developing data pipelines.
    *   **SQL:** Essential for interacting with relational databases and for data transformations.
*   **Workflow Orchestration:**
    *   **Apache Airflow:** Open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring complex data workflows (DAGs).
*   **Big Data Processing:**
    *   **Apache Spark / PySpark:** Unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing, both batch and streaming. PySpark is the Python API for Spark.
*   **Data Streaming:**
    *   **Apache Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and high-performance streaming applications.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   **Data Lakes (e.g., Amazon S3, MinIO):** For storing raw and semi-structured data at scale.
    *   **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB):** Non-relational databases for flexible and scalable data.
    *   **Data Warehousing (e.g., Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Azure Synapse Analytics):** Cloud data warehouse solutions for structured data analysis and complex queries.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Robust and open-source relational database, widely used.
*   **ETL/ELT Tools:**
    *   Tools and frameworks for building Extract, Transform, and Load data pipelines.

## Practical Projects

*   **Building a Data Lake:** Set up a Data Lake using MinIO (local) or Amazon S3, and create a pipeline to ingest data from various sources (e.g., CSVs, APIs) into the lake.
*   **ETL Pipeline with Airflow:** Develop a complete ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow to extract data from a database (PostgreSQL), transform it (with PySpark), and load it into a Data Warehouse (simulated or cloud-based).
*   **Real-Time Data Ingestion System with Kafka and Spark Streaming:** Create a system that ingests real-time event data (e.g., application logs, sensor data) using Apache Kafka, processes it with Spark Streaming, and stores the results.
*   **Data Modeling for a Data Warehouse:** Design the schema for an e-commerce Data Warehouse, including fact and dimension tables, and implement it in PostgreSQL or a cloud solution.
