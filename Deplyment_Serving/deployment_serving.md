# Deployment / Serving

Deployment and Serving refer to the process of putting Machine Learning and Deep Learning models into production, making them accessible for inference and integrating them into applications. This step is crucial for AI models to generate real business value.

## Essential Topics

*   **Inference APIs:** Exposing models as web services (RESTful APIs) so that other applications can make requests and obtain predictions.
*   **Containerization:** Packaging models, their dependencies, and the execution environment into isolated containers to ensure portability and consistency across different environments (development, testing, production).
*   **Model Optimization for Inference:** Techniques to reduce model size, decrease latency, and increase throughput during inference, such as quantization, pruning, and compilation for specific hardware.
*   **Inference Servers:** Dedicated tools and platforms for serving ML models at scale, with features like load balancing, model versioning, and monitoring.
*   **Deployment in Different Environments:** Strategies for deploying models in the cloud, on-premise, on edge devices (Edge AI), and in serverless environments.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of latency, throughput, errors, and resource utilization of models in production.

## Essential Tools and Technologies

*   **Web Frameworks for APIs:**
    *   **FastAPI:** A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It is ideal for serving ML models due to its asynchronous support, data validation with Pydantic, and automatic documentation generation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
    *   **Flask:** A lightweight Python micro-web framework, suitable for smaller APIs or rapid prototyping of inference services.
*   **Containerization:**
    *   **Docker:** The standard tool for creating, deploying, and running applications in containers. Essential for packaging ML models and their dependencies.
*   **Model Optimization and Formats:**
    *   **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange):** An open-source format for representing Deep Learning models, enabling interoperability between different frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and optimization for inference on various hardware.
    *   **TensorFlow Lite (TF Lite):** A lightweight version of TensorFlow for deploying models on mobile and embedded devices (Edge AI), with optimizations for low-latency inference.
    *   **TorchScript:** A way to serialize PyTorch models that can be executed in a high-performance production environment, outside of Python, and optimized for inference.
*   **Inference Servers:**
    *   **BentoML:** An open-source framework for building and deploying high-performance ML inference services, with support for model packaging and APIs.
    *   **Ray Serve:** A library for serving ML models in production, part of the Ray ecosystem, focusing on scalability and flexibility for AI microservices.
    *   **Triton Inference Server (NVIDIA):** A high-performance inference server for Deep Learning models, optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, but also supporting CPUs.
*   **Container Orchestration (for scale):**
    *   **Kubernetes:** The leading platform for orchestrating containers, essential for deploying and scaling containerized applications and ML models in production.

## Practical Projects

*   **Image Classification API with FastAPI and Docker:** Create a RESTful API using FastAPI that receives an image and returns the class predicted by a CNN model. Containerize the application with Docker and test locally.
*   **NLP Inference Service with BentoML:** Package a Natural Language Processing model (e.g., for sentiment analysis) using BentoML and deploy it as a web service, optimizing for low latency.
*   **Edge Device Model Deployment with TF Lite:** Convert a Machine Learning model (e.g., for object detection) to the TensorFlow Lite format and deploy it on an edge device (e.g., Raspberry Pi, smartphone) for local inference.
*   **Scalable Recommendation Service with Ray Serve:** Develop a recommendation service that uses an ML model and serves it at scale using Ray Serve, demonstrating load balancing and high availability.
